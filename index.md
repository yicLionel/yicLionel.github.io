## About Me

Hi there, I am Jiacheng Zhang, a Ph.D. candidate at [Trustworthy Machine Learning and Reasoning Group](https://github.com/tmlr-group) in the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, the University of Melbourne, advised by [Prof. Feng Liu](https://fengliu90.github.io/) and [Prof. Ben Rubinstein](https://www.bipr.net/). Before that, I obtained my Honours degree from the University of Sydney, feeling fortunate to learn from [Prof. Tongliang Liu](https://tongliang-liu.github.io/).

I am passionate about advancing the field of **trustworthy machine learning**, with a long-term vision of enabling **safe, reliable, and ethically aligned AI systems** that can be responsibly deployed in real-world environments. My current research interests lie in improving the **robustness** and **safety** of AI systems at multiple levels, including:
- Safety alignment for multimodal large language models
- Robust fine-tuning for pre-trained vision-language models
- Robust training for vision models

In an era where AI systems are increasingly embedded in high-stakes, real-world decision-making domains, I firmly believe that their foundations must be trustworthy and safe: not as an afterthought, but as a prerequisite for responsible and sustainable societal integration.

*Please feel free to email me for research, collaborations, or a casual chat.*
