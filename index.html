## About Me

Hi there, I am Yichen YAN, an undergraduate student at the University of Melbourne.

I am passionate about advancing the field of **trustworthy machine learning**, with a long-term vision of enabling **safe, reliable, and ethically aligned AI systems** that can be responsibly deployed in real-world environments. My current research interests lie in improving the **robustness** and **safety** of AI systems at multiple levels, including:
- Safety alignment for multimodal large language models
- Robust fine-tuning for pre-trained vision-language models
- Robust training for vision models

In an era where AI systems are increasingly embedded in high-stakes, real-world decision-making domains, I firmly believe that their foundations must be trustworthy and safe: not as an afterthought, but as a prerequisite for responsible and sustainable societal integration.
